#### What are JavaScript Data Types?
Seven data types are primitives:
Boolean, null, Undefined, Number, BigInt, String e Symbol.


#### What is the use of isNaN function?
The isNaN() function is used to check whether the parameters are non-numeric. If this parameter is non-numeric or string value NaN, the object, undefined and others will return true, otherwise it will return false


#### Differentiate between Real DOM and Virtual DOM
DOM is the representation of the components on the page. You manipulate the DOM in order to manipulate these components (create, recreate, change their state). Virtual DOM is a framework for manipulating the DOM

#### List some of the major advantages of React.
Accelerates development and reduces time to market, developed in JavaScript, React Native is Open Source, performance similar to a native app, Modular Architecture, React is SEO friendly, stable and fast.

#### How different is React‚Äôs ES6 syntax when compared to ES5?
ES6 and ES5 syntaxes in ReactJs are Javascript scripting languages in the development industry. ECMA Script or ES is a trademarked scripting language made by ECMA International. The European Computer Manufacture Association or ECMA is used for client-side scripting for the worldwide web. ES5 was released in 2009 and ES6 in 2015. ES5 was good but lengthy. The new ES6 is a major update and enhancement on ES5 in terms of code optimization and readability, in other words, ES-6 syntax helps an individual the long, tedious code bit shorter and easy to understand and grasp easily.

#### What‚Äôs Typescript, why use it?
TypeScript is an open source programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactic superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language.
The potential for error detection during project development and the possibility to include the intelligence (IntelliSense) of the IDE (integrated development environment) that is being used. This reflects in a much more agile and secure environment while the code is being typed by the user.

In addition to helping the development environment, TypeScript allows the use of different "superset" functionalities that are not included in the native form, and also the gradual language migration, reflecting in the increase of the teams' productivity.


#### What‚Äôs state management in React and what libraries would use for this?
Global state management in React ‚Äì How to use Context API. Componentization is one of the bases of the development of a React application and one of the main attractions of the library. It allows different functionalities to be separated into components, which may or may not be related to each other.

About the indicated libraries, we have React's useState as the best option for managing local state. If you need a global state solution, the most popular ones are Redux, MobX and the built-in context API.


#### What is Node.js? What is it used for?
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform software, based on Google's V8 interpreter, that allows the execution of JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
Advantages: Faster development due to the large number of reusable modules and code that can be obtained through npm.
Fewer mistakes are made and it is possible to be more productive as it is a front-end and back-end language.
Fast response time. Better chances of pleasing customers.
Reduced team size and communication overhead (JavaScript fullstack).
Reduce dependency on other teams (e.g. backend API teams).
Ability to reuse code in the browser and on the server.

#### What is Event-driven programming?
Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm. Unlike traditional programs that follow a standardized flow of control, the control flow of event-driven programs is guided by external indications, called events.

#### What is the difference between Asynchronous and Non-blocking?
Blocking methods execute synchronously and non-blocking methods execute asynchronously.


## üìùGIT

#### What is the difference between pull and fetch commands?
Git fetch is the option that can be considered "safe", while git pull can be considered "unsafe". git fetch downloads the remote content and does not change the state of the local repository.

#### What is the difference between Git and Github?
Git is a local VCS software that allows developers to save snapshots of their projects over time - it's best for individual use. GitHub is a web-based platform that incorporates gitHub's version control features so they can be used collaboratively.

#### What is a branch?
The git branch command allows you to create, list, rename and delete branches. It doesn't allow you to switch between branches or gather a forked history again. For this reason, the git branch command is tightly integrated with the git checkout and git merge commands.

#### What is a pull request?
Pull requests allow you to let others know about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review potential changes with contributors and add follow-up commits before the changes are merged into the base branch.
